### Next Steps: Update DBT Models for Data Transformations

**You must update the DBT models** in the `dbt/models/` folder to apply your data transformations. The template includes placeholder models that need to be customized for your use case.

#### Data Transformation Flow:
Data moves through the following layers in your dbt project:

1. **Raw Layer** → Data extracted from Airbyte (source tables)
2. **Staging Layer** (`dbt/models/staging/`) → Clean and standardize raw data
3. **Intermediate Layer** (`dbt/models/intermediate/`) → Business logic and joins
4. **Datamart Layer** (`dbt/models/datamart/`) → Final analytics-ready tables

**Example workflow:**
- Edit `dbt/models/staging/model_stg.sql` to reference your Airbyte raw tables
- Edit `dbt/models/intermediate/model_interm.sql` to add business transformations
- Edit `dbt/models/datamart/model_dm.sql` to create your final analytics tables

Refer to the [dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/) for guidance on writing models.
